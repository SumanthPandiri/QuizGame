# QuizGame

QuizGame takes text files (such as the sample text file, "database.txt") with questions and answers and allows the user to quiz themselves. The game uses stringstreams, vectors, and classes to parse the data in the text and store it in a class. Score is also recorded, and the results are presented at the end.
